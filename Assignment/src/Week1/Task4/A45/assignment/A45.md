Example:

classes needed:
- ServeTime Process (ServeProcess)
- ArrivalTime Process (ArrivalProcess)
- Customer
- ServicePoint
- Clock
- EventList

This pseudo is following the demo code
Run:
- initialize():
  - set up requiremennet to stop simulation
  - simulation = true
  - create clock instance
  - create arrival process instance
  - create serve process instance
  - create service point instance 
    - service point queue
    - service point X (not available in demo code)
    - service point Y (not available in demo code)
  - create event list instance
  - generate initial arrival events
  - add to event list
- run():
  - while simulation():
    - tryPhaseA():
        - get first event in event list
        - set clock to the event time
        - get customer from event
    - tryPhaseB():
      - complete all B-event in sequencial order:
        - if event is arrival event
          - put the customer into the queue of the service block
          - if this B-event is the of B1,B2, or when customer arrive at the first service block
            - generate the next arrival event of  new customer
            - if queue is not full
              - move customer to queue
              - else, remove customer from system
        - if event is exit event
          - set service point to available
          - 
    - tryPhaseC():
      - go to each service point block
        - if there is person in queue and service point is available
          - remove person from queue
          - set service point to busy
          - generate B-event ( exit/finish B-Type event)
          - add to event list
