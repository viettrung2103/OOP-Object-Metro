## Using an example case (health centre, bank, etc.), discuss the meaning and characterisation of all the performance measures discussed in the lesson material using the concepts of the target system.`
Case: Health Centre
The performance measures discussed in the lesson material are:
- Directly observable variables:
  - A, arrived patients count
  - C, served clients count
  - B, active time in service point
  - T, total simulation time
- Derived variables:
  - U, utilization factor: B/T
  - X, Service throughput, the amount of clients served per unit of time: C/T
  - S, service time, the average time a client spends in the service point: B/C
- Addition obersevable variables:
  - Ri, the response time to customer i, from the moment the customer Ri arrives to the queue the moment the customer i leaves the service point.
  - W, the total reponse time, the sum of all customers' response time.
- Derived variables from the addition observable variables:
  - R, average reponse time, a average time a customer spends in the system: W/C
  - N, the average active time, queue + serve time: W/T
