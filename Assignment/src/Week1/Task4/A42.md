### (W) Consider the categories in which performance measures are maintained/updated/computed. (Think in general terms: service point/customer; not in target system terms.)

The categories in which performnace measures are maintained/updated/computed are:
- to Service Point:
  - Directly Observable Variables:
    - B, active time in service point.
    - T, total simulation time.
  - Derived Variables:
    - U, utilization factor.
    - S, service time.
- to Patient:
  - Directly Observable Variables:
    - A, arrived patients count.
    - C, served clients count.
  - Derived Variables:
    - X, Service throughput.
  - Addition Observable Variables:
    - Ri, the response time to customer i.
    - W, the total response time.
  - Derived Variables from the addition observable variables:
    - R, average response time.
    - N, the average active time.
