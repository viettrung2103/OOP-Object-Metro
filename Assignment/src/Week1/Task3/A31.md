# (W) Suppose you are compiling statistics on the age structure of students in our group. You should then draw 1000 age values and these should be distributed in the same way as the age distribution of the students in the group. How do you do it? Explain the algorithm in enough details to be able to program it directly. Take an idea/model from the example on section Your own distribution.
Let assumn that below is my class's age distribution:
We have 35 students: age from 18 - 30:

Age - people - Percentage - Contribution

18  -   3   -   9   -   9

19  -   3   -   9   -   18  

20  -   2   -   6   -   24   

21  -   4   -   11  -   35  

22  -   4   -   11  -   46  

23  -   2   -   6   -   52

24  -   5   -   14  -   66

25  -   3   -   9   -   73

26  -   3   -   9   -   82  

27  -   2   -   6   -   88  

28  -   2   -   6   -   94

29  -   1   -   3   -   97  

30  -   1   -   3   -   100  
Sum  : 35 people -  100%

So now we have the same distribution for 1000 people, here is the result:
Age - people - Percentage - Contribution:

18  -   86  -   9   -   9

19  -   86  -   9   -   18

20  -   57  -   6   -   24

21  -   114 -   11  -   35

22  -   114 -   11  -   46

23  -   57  -   6   -   52

24  -   143 -   14  -   66

25  -   86  -   9   -   73

26  -   86  -   9   -   82

27  -   57  -   6   -   88

28  -   57  -   6   -   94

29  -   29  -   3   -   97

30  -   29  -   3   -   100  

Sum: 1000 people, 100%


Algorith:
- We apply 2 ideas
  - the P of randomly pick a number from 1-100 is 1/100 = 1%
  - The P to randomly pick age 18 is 9%
  - Random number is uniform distribution
  - Age is based on probability mass, which mean, age 18 has mass 9, age 19 has mass 9
- Combine them, we can have this:
  - we have a bag with 100 balls inside, marked with numbers from "18" to "30", and number from 1- 100 with this distribution:
    - ball number 1-9 have "18"
    - ball number 10-18 have "19"
    - ball number 19-24 have "20"
    - ball number 25-35 have "21"
    - ball number 36-46 have "22"
    - ball number 47-52 have "23"
    - ball number 53-66 have "24"
    - ball number 67-73 have "25"
    - ball number 74-82 have "26"
    - ball number 83-88 have "27"
    - ball number 89-94 have "28"
    - ball number 95-97 have "29"
    - ball number 98-100 have "30"
  - We also have a table with mark from 0 to 30
    - For 1000 times:
      - Every time a ball is draw from a bag
        - If a ball has number from 1-9, we will add 1 to mark 18 on the table
        - if a ball has a number from 10-18, we will add 1 to mark 19 on the table
    - After 1000 times, the final number on the table is the results of age distribution of 1000 people according the reference age distribuion.
  - Apply to programming:
    - we need 2 arrays:
    - one array is the age distribution with the format {randomNumber, age} with randomNumber is the maximum randomNumber of that Age. In this case, random Number 9 is the maximum random number corresponding to age 18.
    - one array is to store the occurence of that age, using List with size = maxAge(30)+1
      - Get a random number, compare that number with the first array in order to find the corresponding age 
      - if we have a number 9, which is corresponding to age 18, list[18] ++; 
    - As we need ages for 1000 people, we will interate 1000 times
    - Afterward, we will print out the result of the second array
