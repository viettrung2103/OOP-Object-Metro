# (W) Familiarize yourself with a few distributions that could be used in the simulator for experimentation. These distributions could be used in the following situations. Find answers online. You can also study other distributions. For example, Google "real life example of normal distribution".

1. Normal Distribution is a unimodal graph, which has only 1 peak.
   - nuy and sigma are two import property, one is mean value, another is standard deviation
     - one standard deviation contain 68% of population
     - two standardd deviation contain 95% of population
     - three standard deviation contain 98.5% of population
   - it is follow Central Limit Theorem:
     - When the sample increasing and becomings big enough, the sample's mean or sum approach normal distribution
   - The mean is the median of sample
2. Example:
    - HighSchool Grade
    - Height/ Weight
    - Shoe Size
    - IQ level
